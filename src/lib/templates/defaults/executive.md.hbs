## Business Continuity Considerations

### Critical Infrastructure
- **Power grids** may experience minor fluctuations during elevated geomagnetic activity
- **Satellite operations** should maintain standard protocols with enhanced monitoring
- **Aviation routes** over polar regions may require alternative planning during severe events

### Communications
- **HF radio communications** may experience intermittent disruptions
- **GNSS/GPS accuracy** could be reduced during active periods
- **Backup communication systems** should be tested and ready

### Timeline for Next Review
- **Next automatic update:** {{formatDate (addHours generatedAt 6) "MMM dd 'at' p 'UTC'"}}
- **Emergency updates:** Issued as conditions warrant
- **Full assessment review:** Daily at 12:00 UTC
